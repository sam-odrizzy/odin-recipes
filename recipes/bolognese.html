        <p>Bolognese has, for centuries, brought joy to the world. However, in 2023, Sam O'Driscoll split the history of bologonese in two (before Sam and after Sam) when he invented Sam's Spag Bol, a revolutionary take on a traditional dish. For the first time in history, he's putting fingers to keyboard and recording this dish for the world to see.</p>
